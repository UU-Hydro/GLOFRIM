# PCR-GLOBWB with BMI
This repository contains code of the global hydrologic model PCR-GLOBWB extended with Basic Model Interface (BMI) functionality.
The code is developed and applied with GLOFRIM, a globally applicable computational framework for integrated hydrologicalâ€“hydrodynamic modelling (Hoch et al., 2017, https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/3913/2017/).

### Important note
Maintanence and development of the code are independent of the original PCR-GLOBWB source code. It may thus be that certain features of the original version are not (yet) covered here.
